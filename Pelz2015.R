# attention switching model from PelzPiantadosiKidd ICDL 2015

# parameters:
# (A) the learning curve that the learner follows as he attends to the stimulus, 
# (B) memory decay rate, as a model of the learner’s short term memory limitations, 
# (C) the cost of switching attention between objects (0.5), and 
# (D) the amount of information that the learner knows about the objects at the start of test. 

# Attention allows accumulation of data about an object, but there is a diminishing return 
# as the learner comes to know everything that can be learned about each object. 
# Importantly, these objects are best thought of as dynamic stimuli that will change when unattended, 
# meaning that information will be lost about them when attention is oriented elsewhere.

# At each timestep, the model computes the amount of information that it expects to gain from each object, 
# and chooses whether to continue to attend to the current object or to switch to another based on the 
# expected information gains

# learning curve: Gompertz
info_gain <- function(t, a=100, b=1, c=1) {
  # returns amount of information known about each object at time t, 
  # a is the maximum amount of information that can be learned from each object (fixed at 100 bits), 
  # b characterizes the amount of initial information, 
  # c is the learning rate (fixed at 1.0 for simplicity)
  return( a*exp(-b*exp(-c*t)) )
}

# with b=0, you get a

  # chi=0 - random choice, chi=Inf - perfect maximization;
